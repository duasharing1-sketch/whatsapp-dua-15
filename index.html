const message = `*Ya Allah, make me grateful and generous*

This powerful dua calls upon Allah ﷻ — by His Names Ash-Shakūr (The Most Appreciative) and Al-Wahhāb (The Bestower of Gifts) — to fill our hearts with sincere gratitude for His countless blessings. It asks for an increase in generosity that flows beyond words into meaningful actions, so every gift we receive becomes a means of pleasing Him and benefiting others.

Because true gratitude is not only felt, but shown in how we give and share.

“If you are grateful, I will surely increase you.” — Qur’an 14:7

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Shakoor (O Most Appreciative), Ya Wahhab (O Bestower of Gifts), make us among those who are sincerely grateful to You for all Your countless blessings. We acknowledge Your boundless generosity towards us, so increase us in generosity as well, and include us among those who are truly generous. Inspire our hearts to show this gratitude, not just through words but through our actions. Help us use every blessing and gift You give us in ways that please You.*

This dua is part of *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a powerful collection of heartfelt supplications designed to benefit you in both this life and the next. 

*At Dua Sharing, our mission is simple*: 

To encourage sincere dua, meaningful sharing, and to multiply blessings through a growing global chain of people making dua for one another every single day.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

“The supplication of a Muslim for his brother in his absence will certainly be answered. Every time he makes a supplication for good for his brother, the angel appointed for this task says: ‘Ameen! And may it be for you too.”

Every post we share is taken directly from the full Supplication of Infinite Blessings — with the aim of moving hearts, inspiring action, and reminding us all of what truly matters.
